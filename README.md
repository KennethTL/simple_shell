# simple_shell Project

- Step 1: Wrote a program that simply outputs whatever is written to the cli for the shell.
- Step 2: Keeping the shell in a loop
- Step 3: Make sure the Shell is able to keep track of the built-in commands and files
- step 4: Writing a program that grabs the location of files

Errors Encountered:

- Implicit declaration of function errors : This is usually due to not importing the header file or the right header file.
- _struct stat buffer_ the buffer in question should be a pointer.
